**This repository showcases various fundamental machine learning concepts and techniques implemented in Python.**

**Content:**

Some Basic Codes that are prerequisites (I have made a separate file for this case).

Regression: Code examples for linear regression and other regression techniques.

Scaling: Implementation of Standard Scaler and Min Max Scaler for data preprocessing.

Classification: Code for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and basic understanding of classification algorithms.

Clustering: Exploration of K-Means clustering with code examples.
